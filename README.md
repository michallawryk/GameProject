# Rusty Friends Game

Short description
-----------------

This is a Unity game prototype made as my bachelor degree thesis. The repository includes all source assets, scenes.

Rusty Friends is a cooperative puzzle-platformer designed to show that collaboration and communication are essential to overcoming challenges. Players must work together to solve environment-based puzzles, manipulate objects, and navigate obstacles that are impossible to complete alone. The game mechanics, level design, and scripted encounters are intentionally built to reward teamwork and shared problem-solving.
